## Overview

This project, "GameCoreFramework (GCF)," takes the modern architecture of Unreal Engine 5 (such as Lyra Starter Game), deconstructs it, and redesigns it as a **universal game framework** independent of any specific game genre.

Instead of merely extracting convenient features, it is built on the premise of conditions where design is most likely to break down in production: multiplayer, possession, late-joiners, and dynamic feature injection.
It aims to provide an architectural answer to questions like "Why does it break?" and "Where should the boundaries of responsibility be drawn?"

## 🛑 Problems Solved and Objectives

In game development involving multiplayer and complex player behaviors, the following problems frequently occur:

- **Ambiguous Responsibilities:** Confusion over where to place logic (Pawn, Controller, or PlayerState) often leads to the creation of "God Classes."
- **Initialization Race Conditions:** Input, Ability, and Camera systems depend on each other, causing crashes due to inconsistent load orders.
- **State Desync:** Network latency and late-joiners cause discrepancies between the visual representation and the internal state.
- **Chain of Tight Coupling:** Direct coupling between inputs and abilities makes it difficult to swap out actors or playable characters.

The primary objective of this project is to create a structure that prevents these issues **through systemic architecture, rather than relying on operational care (the programmer's attentiveness).**

### 💡 Benefits of Adoption

By adopting this framework, development teams will reap the following benefits:

- Eliminates confusion about "where to write what" when dealing with possession and late-joiners.
- Frees developers from the hassle of individually tweaking initialization order bugs and complex dependencies between systems.
- Ensures the core design remains intact even when expanding gameplay mechanics like "riding vehicles" or "transforming into other characters."

## 📐 Core Design Philosophy

### 1. Clear Separation of "Soul" (Player) and "Body" (Pawn)
This framework clearly separates the responsibilities of persistent data and temporary vessels.

- **Player (Soul / Persistent):** Defines stats and persistent abilities that are maintained even when switching bodies (Pawns) (primarily handled by the PlayerState). Uses "Possession" of a body as a trigger to activate the features inherent to that body.
- **Pawn (Body / Temporary):** A physical entity that only defines the innate abilities and input bindings that its "shell" should possess (e.g., "accelerate/brake" for a car, "jump/walk" for a human).

This separation prevents logic from breaking in games involving possession and allows for the natural implementation of gameplay involving body-swapping.

### 2. Hybridization of Event-Driven and State-Based Models
Initially, the design was purely event-driven (using notifications via Delegates). However, we faced limitations unique to asynchronous multiplayer, such as "late-joiners missing past events" and "crashes caused by initialization order when relying on fleeting events like `OnPossessed`."

Therefore, we transitioned to a **hybrid architecture that treats these as "States" rather than events**, utilizing the `InitState` of the GameFrameworkComponentManager (GFCM). By implementing strict gate control that "prevents progressing to the next state until data, possession, and logic are all present," we achieved a robust structure where "the current situation can be accurately replicated at any time of joining, based on the state at that moment."

### 3. Gameplay Expansion via Data-Driven Design
We adopted a design where behaviors and abilities are not hardcoded in C++, but rather expanded through variations in DataAssets. Pawn and Ability configurations can be flexibly switched according to the gameplay.

### 4. Minimizing Baseline Overhead via Tickless Design
Fundamentally built on an **Event-Driven Model**, this framework strictly eliminates reliance on per-frame `Tick` processing (`PrimaryComponentTick.bCanEverTick = true`) across its components.
By deeply integrating with Gameplay Messages, Component Extension Events, and multicast delegates, unnecessary state polling has been eradicated.

This architectural approach **minimizes the framework's baseline CPU overhead**, maximizing overall scalability. As a result, it ensures ample CPU headroom is preserved for complex gameplay logic and high-density actor physics simulations.

## ✨ Unique Features of This Framework

### 1. Dual ASC Architecture and Tag-Based Routing
In standard Gameplay Ability System (GAS) design, it is customary to place the Ability System Component (ASC) on *either* the PlayerState or the Pawn. However, to clearly separate persistent abilities from swappable abilities, this framework adopts an architecture that **equips both the PlayerState (Soul) and the Pawn (Body) with an ASC (Dual ASC Architecture)**.

The greatest technical challenge in this unique setup is the input routing problem: "When a player presses a button, to which ASC (Soul or Body) should the input be dispatched?"
To eliminate tight coupling where inputs directly reference specific Ability classes or ASCs, this framework introduces the `InputBridge` and `AbilityRouter`.

The `UGCFAbilityInputRouterComponent` automatically dispatches inputs based on the hierarchy of the tag passed during input, following these rules:
- 🟢 When an `InputTag.Ability.Player.*` tag is received:
    - Routed to the **PlayerState's ASC** (Handled as a persistent ability of the soul, e.g., interaction).
- 🟠 When an `InputTag.Ability.Pawn.*` tag is received:
    - Routed to the **Pawn's ASC** (Handled as an ability dependent on the current body, e.g., jumping or shooting).

As a result, the input side (Controller or InputComponent) does not need to know "whose ASC it is." It becomes possible to **dynamically switch the execution target simply by throwing a "Tag."**

### 2. Next-Gen Movement System (Mover) Integration and Loosely Coupled Architecture
To maximize the potential of Unreal Engine 5's next-generation movement system, the "Mover" plugin, we have built a clean, lightweight `APawn`-based movement foundation that does not depend on the legacy `ACharacter`.

- **The Intent "Bucket Relay" (Push ➔ Cache ➔ Pull):**
  Communication from the player's "movement intent" to "physical behavior" is clearly separated via interfaces. The input side throws the intent (Push) without caring about the target's class; the Pawn interprets and retains it based on its own body (Cache); and finally, the Mover's producer extracts it (Pull). This realizes a highly decoupled architecture. Consequently, even if a player's possession switches from a "jumping human" to a "non-jumping car," operations switch seamlessly without breaking the code.

- **Maintaining Clock Sync in Hybrid Environments (Adapter Pattern):**
  In game environments where the legacy `CharacterMovementComponent` (CMC) and the new `Mover` (Network Prediction Plugin) coexist, the simulation clock tends to isolate and sleep per system. This causes issues where, when a player operates a CMC, network packets from others' Movers (e.g., drones) are discarded as "future data," leading to freezing (Extrapolation Starvation).
  This system builds a robust infrastructure by placing a **"lightweight, physics-less dummy Mover"** on the `PlayerController` as an Adapter that constantly communicates with the server, keeping the network clock globally synchronized regardless of the possessed Pawn.

## 🛠 Developer Experience (DX): Simple Extensibility Encapsulating Complex Internals

Although this framework executes extremely complex asynchronous processing and routing internally, **it suppresses (encapsulates) this complexity to a minimum for the programmers and planners (users) who actually implement the gameplay.**

When adding new features, users do not need to modify existing core code. Safe expansion is possible through the following extremely simple steps.

### Example 1: Binding New Abilities and Inputs by Planners (Data-Driven)
There is no need to write new C++ code. By simply configuring two DataAssets that separate "ability definition" and "physical input," the system automatically determines the appropriate ASC (Soul or Body) and performs the routing.

#### 1. Assign an "Input Tag" to the Ability (`UGCFAbilitySet`)
Open the target ability set and configure the following elements:

- **Granted Gameplay Abilities:**
  - **Ability:** `GA_Jump` (The ability class to add)
  - **InputTag:** `InputTag.Ability.Pawn.Jump` (Target domain automatically determined by the prefix)

#### 2. Bind Physical Operations (InputAction) to the Tag (`UGCFInputConfig`)
Open the input configuration and simply bind the standard Unreal InputAction to the tag defined above.

- **Ability Input Actions:**
  - **InputAction:** `IA_Jump` (Physical input such as Spacebar or gamepad button)
  - **GameplayTag:** `InputTag.Ability.Pawn.Jump`

### Example 2: Adding a "New Vehicle" by Programmers (Interface-Driven Opt-In)
For example, if you want to add a "Hoverboard" with entirely new physics behavior, you do not need to rewrite the input processing (`Input_Move`, etc.) on the controller side.
Simply implement the `IGCFLocomotionInputHandler` interface in the new Pawn class, receive the universal "movement intent (vector)," and interpret it as its unique propulsion force.

```cpp
// AGCFHoverboardPawn.cpp
// Just by overriding the interface function, it receives universal operations "pushed" from the controller.
void AGCFHoverboardPawn::HandleMoveInput_Implementation(const FVector2D& InputValue, const FRotator& MovementRotation)
{
    // Cache the "desired direction intent" calculated by the controller,
    // and convert it into physics thruster processing specific to the hoverboard.
    CachedMoveInput = InputValue;
    CachedMoveRotation = MovementRotation;
    UpdateHoverThrusters();
}
```

By simply operating "inside the rules of the architecture" like this, we provide a foundation where anyone can safely and rapidly mass-produce features.

## 🎯 Non-Goals and Target Scope

### Design Philosophy: Robustness over Speed

Rather than the initial speed of prototyping, this framework makes ensuring **"Mid-to-Long-Term Scalability"** and **"Deterministic Behavior"** its top design priorities.

To add a single button, it requires explicit procedures (rules) such as "creating a DataAsset" and "assigning a tag." Therefore, initial setup and learning require a certain cost. However, because of this enforced structure, **"adding the 100th ability" can be done with the exact same safety and order as "adding the 1st."**

When entering mid-to-long-term specification changes or a mass-production phase with a team of dozens, the iteration speed enabled by this "unbreakable foundation" will ultimately vastly outperform traditional prototype-style development.

**[Projects Where It Delivers the Most Value]**
- Large-scale multiplayer games or long-term live-service titles planned for years of operation.
- Teams wanting to drastically reduce programmer QA (debugging) costs during content mass production.
- Games where "boarding vehicles" or "dynamic character changes (Possession)" are core mechanics.

**[Projects Where It Might Be Over-Engineering]**
- Mockup development intended to be thrown away in a few weeks without considering scalability.
- Small-scale games completed with only a single Pawn and single perspective, without any multiplayer or state transitions expected.

### ⚠️ About Performance Trade-offs
While this framework's "tickless design" is a powerful approach to lowering baseline CPU overhead, it relies heavily on event and state-monitoring driven models like `GameplayMessageRouter` and `GameFrameworkComponentManager (GFCM)`. 
Because of this, **if these systems are abused for extremely high-frequency processing that fires every frame (e.g., as a complete replacement for Tick), the overhead of delegate calls can conversely lead to an overall decrease in performance**. This is an architectural pitfall to be aware of. It is crucial to maintain a balance: use these systems appropriately, while ensuring that processes which genuinely need to Tick (such as physics calculations or per-frame camera updates) continue to be handled via Tick.

## 🚀 Future Outlook and Roadmap (Future Integrations)

In its initial phase, this framework prioritized proving the "robustness of the core foundation" (separation of concerns, asynchronous lifecycles, and established routing). Therefore, it was built as a **minimum configuration, intentionally stripping away "cosmetic decorations" and "features dependent on specific game experiences" that do not directly affect the logic's behavior**.

Now that the robust routing foundation and lifecycle management are complete, the next phase involves integrating the following features as **loosely coupled modules (GameFeatures or independent components)** on top of this skeleton:

**[Upcoming Modules for Implementation]**
- **User Facing Experience & UI Routing:** Full integration of `CommonUI` and `CommonGame` to build a seamless transition from the title screen to in-game, alongside a foundation for dynamic asset loading per Experience (leveraging PrimaryAssetLabels).

- **Cosmetic & Feedback System:** Utilizing features like `GameplayCue` from the Gameplay Ability System to integrate mechanisms that dynamically apply visual and auditory feedback (e.g., character animations, VFX, sounds) without polluting the logic.

## 🖋️ Developer's Vision: A Philosophy on Architecture Design

To me, system architecture design transcends mere engineering; it is a form of self-expression.
Releasing this "GameCoreFramework" as an open-source project is not simply about providing a convenient tool, but rather an answer that embodies what I consider an ideal design.

Modern game development grows more complex by the day, but I firmly believe that from a long-term perspective, building a robust and flexible design ultimately leads to maximizing the fun of the game.

Facing complex phenomena head-on, repeating trial and error, stripping away the excess, and refining it into an optimal form.
I believe there is undeniable value in that very process of thought and exploration.
Even in a future where every development process becomes automated and highly efficient, I believe the value of capturing the true essence with our own hands and minds to build beautiful structures will never fade.

I hope that the design philosophies and ideas poured into this framework will serve as a source of inspiration for engineers who share a love for "beautiful and highly maintainable systems."
